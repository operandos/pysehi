ipynb files to run in Jupyter notebook for standard processing and analysis routines.

## Get started
In Anaconda Prompt run:
  1) `activate sehi`
  2) `cd *...\some_path\pysehi*`  
  **note** - if pysehi is in a different drive (eg. *G:*) to the default (eg *C:*), switch drive first by running `g:`
